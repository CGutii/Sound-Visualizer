# Music Visualizer for SHPE 2024

## Overview
This project was developed in Spring 2024 with the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) at the University of Central Florida (UCF). It features an innovative audio visualizing system that uses an ELEGOO UNO R3 board, a KY-038 sound sensor, and an 8x8 MAX7219 LED matrix to display audio equalizer levels dynamically, creating an engaging LED matrix music visualizer effect.

## Hardware
- **Microcontroller:** ELEGOO UNO R3
- **Sound Sensor:** KY-038
- **Display:** 8x8 MAX7219 LED Matrix

## How It Works
The KY-038 sound sensor picks up audio signals which are then processed by the ELEGOO UNO R3. The processed signals are visually represented as equalizer levels on the 8x8 LED matrix, creating a synchronized music visualizer.

## Repository Contents
- **Code:** All source files and example sketches.
- **Images:** Photos and diagrams of the setup.
- **Schematics:** Detailed wiring and circuit diagrams.
- **Budget:** A detailed budget outlining the project costs.
